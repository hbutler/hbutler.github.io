# Current Research

## Record Linkage for Genealogy

My research currently focuses on developing better statistical record linkage methods to apply to data on those who were enslaved in America's antebellum south.

### Data

The data being used for this work has been collected, organized, transcribed, digitized, etc. by historians.
Without their invaluable work, my research would not be possible.
